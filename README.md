# Extrusion 3D printer with integrated laser profile sensor - in NUS

## 1 Introduction

A 2D Laser profile sensor is integrated to a 3D printer to achieve 3D scan,which is shown below.

The system is consist of sensor, motion control platform and pneumatic extrusion system. They are connected to a PC via Ethernet or Serial Port.

Printing Gcode are generated by open source Slicer software, and are read and sent by a open sourece user interface software.

When Printing, command are sent by PC via serial port to control board, and are decoded and executed on the board.

A set of programme are built to enable scanning function in matlab.

When scanning, it is necessary to coordinate the motion and the sensor. The PC controls the motion platform to move a step through the serial port, and then communicates with the sensor through Ethernet to obtain the cross section. This cycle continues until the scan is completed.
